This little example is ought to be an entry into functional programming for me.
The following is a simple implementation of a LinkedList.

To run this programm locally [install haskell and the ghc](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/intro.html#obtaining-ghc).
Then type: 

```sh
ghci List.hs
```

FYI, end the haskell shell with \<ctrl d\>, not \<ctrl c\> as commonly known for linux tools.
